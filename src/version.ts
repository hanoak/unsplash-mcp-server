/**
 * Server/bin identity reported to MCP clients. `PACKAGE_VERSION` is read from
 * package.json's `version` field at startup — package.json is the single
 * source of truth, so there is no manual sync step (Changesets bumps it; the
 * running server reflects it). package.json is always shipped in the published
 * tarball and sits one level up from the bundled `dist/index.js`, so the
 * relative resolve holds both when installed and when run from source.
 * `PACKAGE_NAME` is the unscoped bin name (`unsplash-mcp-server`) — NOT
 * package.json's scoped `name` field (`@hanoak/unsplash-mcp-server`).
